# Design pattern categories:
- Creational: deal with object creation
  - Explicit (constructor) vs Implicit (DI, reflection)
- Structural:
  - concern about structure of class members
  - a lot of them are wrappers around classes
  - stress the importance of good API design
- Behavioral: deal with communication between objects
- Concurrency: deal with multi-threaded paradigms
